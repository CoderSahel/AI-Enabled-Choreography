# AI-Enabled-Choreography

1. Utilize motion capture data in .npy format with shape (# joints, # timesteps, # dimensions) to visualize dance sequences.
2. Construct a 3D plotting function to depict dancer movements over time, with joints represented as points.
3. Train a generative model like a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with LSTM layers to generate short dance phrases.
4. Compare input sequences from a test set with their decoded counterparts using the VAE model.
5 .Generate new dance sequences using the trained model and visualize them alongside real sequences for evaluation.
