Train a generative model like a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with LSTM layers to generate short dance phrases. Compare input sequences from a test set with their decoded counterparts using the VAE model. Generate new dance sequences using the trained model and visualize them alongside real sequences for evaluation.
